**Tech Stack:**

* HTML5
* CSS3

**Project Overview:**

This project simulates the basic functionalities of a music player, including features like a play/pause button, and a progress bar. It is designed to showcase the use of HTML for structuring the web page and CSS for styling the layout and visual elements.

**Running the Project:**

1.  Ensure you have a text editor or an IDE like Visual Studio Code to open the HTML and CSS files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.
3.  The web page should load in your default browser.

* `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that defines the content and structure of the web page.
* `styles.css`: This CSS file contains the styles that are applied to the HTML elements in `index.html`.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic project and can be extended further by incorporating functionalities like:

*  Adding JavaScript to enable interactive elements like working play/pause button and progress bar update.
*  Integrating with Spotify API to fetch real-time song data and playlists.
*  Implementing user authentication for personalized playlists.
